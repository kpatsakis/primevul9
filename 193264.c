static void renameOnEndOfStudy()
    /*
     * This function deals with renaming the last study's output files. In detail, these file's
     * current filenames will be changed to a filename that corresponds to the pattern [modality-
     * prefix][consecutive-numbering]. The current filenames of all files that belong to the study
     * are captured in outputFileNameArray. The new filenames will be calculated within this
     * function: The [modality-prefix] will be taken from the old filename,
     * [consecutive-numbering] is a consecutively numbered, 6 digit number which will be calculated
     * starting from 000001.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *   none.
