	 * work, we align the range to biggest of the two pages so
	 * that page allocator won't try to merge buddies from
	 * different pageblocks and change MIGRATE_ISOLATE to some
	 * other migration type.
	 *
	 * Once the pageblocks are marked as MIGRATE_ISOLATE, we
	 * migrate the pages from an unaligned range (ie. pages that
	 * we are interested in).  This will put all the pages in
	 * range back to page allocator as MIGRATE_ISOLATE.
	 *
	 * When this is done, we take the pages in range from page
	 * allocator removing them from the buddy system.  This way
	 * page allocator will never consider using them.
	 *
	 * This lets us mark the pageblocks back as
	 * MIGRATE_CMA/MIGRATE_MOVABLE so that free pages in the
	 * aligned range but not in the unaligned, original range are
	 * put back to page allocator so that buddy can use them.
