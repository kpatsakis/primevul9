	 * possible measurments of the TSC correspond to one measurement of any
	 * other clock, and so a spread of values is possible.  This is not a
	 * problem for the computation of the nanosecond clock; with TSC rates
	 * around 1GHZ, there can only be a few cycles which correspond to one
	 * nanosecond value, and any path through this code will inevitably
	 * take longer than that.  However, with the kernel_ns value itself,
	 * the precision may be much lower, down to HZ granularity.  If the
	 * first sampling of TSC against kernel_ns ends in the low part of the
	 * range, and the second in the high end of the range, we can get:
	 *
	 * (TSC - offset_low) * S + kns_old > (TSC - offset_high) * S + kns_new
	 *
	 * As the sampling errors potentially range in the thousands of cycles,
	 * it is possible such a time value has already been observed by the
	 * guest.  To protect against this, we must compute the system time as
	 * observed by the guest and ensure the new system time is greater.
