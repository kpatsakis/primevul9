	 * referencing XFRM dsts so that we can invalidate them.  It
	 * is just too much work.  Instead we make the checks here on

	 *
	 *	XFRM dst A --> IPv4 dst X
	 *
	 * X is the "xdst->route" of A (X is also the "dst->path" of A
	 * in this example).  If X is marked obsolete, "A" will not
	 * notice.  That's what we are validating here via the
	 * stale_bundle() check.
	 *
	 * When a dst is removed from the fib tree, DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD will
	 * be marked on it.
	 * This will force stale_bundle() to fail on any xdst bundle with
	 * this dst linked in it.
