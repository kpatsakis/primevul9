static void executeOnReception()
    /*
     * This function deals with the execution of the command line which was passed
     * to option --exec-on-reception of the storescp. This command line is captured
     * in opt_execOnReception. Note that the command line can contain the placeholders
     * PATH_PLACEHOLDER and FILENAME_PLACEHOLDER which need to be substituted before the command line is actually
     * executed. PATH_PLACEHOLDER will be substituted by the path to the output directory into which
     * the last file was written; FILENAME_PLACEHOLDER will be substituted by the filename of the last
     * file which was written.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *   none.
