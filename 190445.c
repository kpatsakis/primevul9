    By default we don't reconnect because it could silently corrupt data (after
    reconnection you potentially lose table locks, user variables, session
    variables (transactions but they are specifically dealt with in
    mysql_reconnect()).
    This is a change: < 5.0.3 mysql->reconnect was set to 1 by default.
    How this change impacts existing apps:
    - existing apps which relyed on the default will see a behaviour change;
    they will have to set reconnect=1 after mysql_real_connect().
    - existing apps which explicitely asked for reconnection (the only way they
    could do it was by setting mysql.reconnect to 1 after mysql_real_connect())
    will not see a behaviour change.
    - existing apps which explicitely asked for no reconnection
    (mysql.reconnect=0) will not see a behaviour change.
