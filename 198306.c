	/* RFC 2960 6.4 Multi-homed SCTP Endpoints
	 *
	 * An endpoint SHOULD transmit reply chunks (e.g., SACK,
	 * HEARTBEAT ACK, etc.) to the same destination transport
	 * address from which it received the DATA or control chunk to
	 * which it is replying.  This rule should also be followed if
	 * the endpoint is bundling DATA chunks together with the
	 * reply chunk.
	 *
	 * However, when acknowledging multiple DATA chunks received
	 * in packets from different source addresses in a single
	 * SACK, the SACK chunk may be transmitted to one of the
	 * destination transport addresses from which the DATA or
	 * control chunks being acknowledged were received.
	 *
	 * [BUG:  We do not implement the following paragraph.
	 * Perhaps we should remember the last transport we used for a
	 * SACK and avoid that (if possible) if we have seen any
	 * duplicates. --piggy]
	 *
	 * When a receiver of a duplicate DATA chunk sends a SACK to a
	 * multi- homed endpoint it MAY be beneficial to vary the
	 * destination address and not use the source address of the
	 * DATA chunk.  The reason being that receiving a duplicate
	 * from a multi-homed endpoint might indicate that the return
	 * path (as specified in the source address of the DATA chunk)
	 * for the SACK is broken.
	 *
	 * [Send to the address from which we last received a DATA chunk.]
