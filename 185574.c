		 *
		 * There's one open issue:
		 *
		 * The EIO will be only reported on the next IO
		 * operation and then cleared through the IO map.
		 * Normally Linux has two mechanisms to pass IO error
		 * first through the AS_EIO flag in the address space
		 * and then through the PageError flag in the page.
		 * Since we drop pages on memory failure handling the
		 * only mechanism open to use is through AS_AIO.
		 *
		 * This has the disadvantage that it gets cleared on
		 * the first operation that returns an error, while
		 * the PageError bit is more sticky and only cleared
		 * when the page is reread or dropped.  If an
		 * application assumes it will always get error on
		 * fsync, but does other operations on the fd before
		 * and the page is dropped between then the error
		 * will not be properly reported.
		 *
		 * This can already happen even without hwpoisoned
		 * pages: first on metadata IO errors (which only
		 * report through AS_EIO) or when the page is dropped
		 * at the wrong time.
		 *
		 * So right now we assume that the application DTRT on
		 * the first EIO, but we're not worse than other parts
		 * of the kernel.
