   have set the allow flags into the address, and also set the uid/gid required.
   Having the routers generate new addresses and then checking them here at
   the outer level is tidier than making each router do the checking, and
   means that routers don't need access to the failed address queue.

 . Break up the address into local part and domain, and make lowercased
   versions of these strings. We also make unquoted versions of the local part.

 . Handle the percent hack for those domains for which it is valid.

 . For child addresses, determine if any of the parents have the same address.
   If so, generate a different string for previous delivery checking. Without
   this code, if the address spqr generates spqr via a forward or alias file,
   delivery of the generated spqr stops further attempts at the top level spqr,
   which is not what is wanted - it may have generated other addresses.

 . Check on the retry database to see if routing was previously deferred, but
   only if in a queue run. Addresses that are to be routed are put on the
   addr_route chain. Addresses that are to be deferred are put on the
   addr_defer chain. We do all the checking first, so as not to keep the
   retry database open any longer than necessary.

 . Now we run the addresses through the routers. A router may put the address
   on either the addr_local or the addr_remote chain for local or remote
   delivery, respectively, or put it on the addr_failed chain if it is
   undeliveable, or it may generate child addresses and put them on the
   addr_new chain, or it may defer an address. All the chain anchors are
   passed as arguments so that the routers can be called for verification
   purposes as well.

 . If new addresses have been generated by the routers, da capo.

    attempt. If it fails again, the address will be failed. This ensures that
    each address is routed at least once, even after long-term routing
    failures.

    If there is an address retry, check that too; just wait for the next
    retry time. This helps with the case when the temporary error on the
    address was really message-specific rather than address specific, since
    it allows other messages through.

    We also wait for the next retry time if this is a message sent down an
    existing SMTP connection (even though that will be forced). Otherwise there
    will be far too many attempts for an address that gets a 4xx error. In

    not be remembered as one this message needs. However, there was a bug that

    Even if we haven't reached the retry time in the hints, there is one more
    check to do, which is for the ultimate address timeout. We only do this
    check if there is an address retry record and there is not a domain retry
    record; this implies that previous attempts to handle the address had the
    retry_use_local_parts option turned on. We use this as an approximation
    for the destination being like a local delivery, for example delivery over

pipes for any of the deferred addresses, handle one-time aliases, and see if
the message has been on the queue for so long that it is time to send a warning
message to the sender, unless it is a mailer-daemon. If all deferred addresses
have the same domain, we can set deliver_domain for the expansion of
delay_warning_ condition - if any of them are pipes, files, or autoreplies, use
the parent's domain.

If all the deferred addresses have an error number that indicates "retry time
not reached", skip sending the warning message, because it won't contain the
reason for the delay. It will get sent at the next real delivery attempt.
However, if at least one address has tried, we'd better include all of them in
the message.

If we can't make a process to send the message, don't worry.

For mailing list expansions we want to send the warning message to the
mailing list manager. We can't do a perfect job here, as some addresses may
have different errors addresses, but if we take the errors address from
each deferred address it will probably be right in most cases.

If addr_defer == +1, it means there was a problem sending an error message
